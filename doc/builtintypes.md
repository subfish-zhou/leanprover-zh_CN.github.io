# Builtin Types

## Numeric Operations

Lean supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.
The following code shows how you’d use each one in a `def` commands:

```lean
-- addition
def sum := 5 + 10

-- subtraction
def difference := 95.5 - 4.3

-- multiplication
def product := 4 * 30

-- division
def quotient := 53.7 / 32.2

-- remainder/modulo
def modulo := 43 % 5
```

Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates to a single value.
